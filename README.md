# Kainos-challange
In the project I built a regression model to predict bus delays in Gda≈Ñsk for Kaggle competition organized by Kainos for DataMass conference 2018. The model won the competition. The description of competition as well as all required files can be found on:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/kainoscompetition
The repository contain 4 files with the phases of my project:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Features Engineering
3. Model Creation
4. Model Tuning
